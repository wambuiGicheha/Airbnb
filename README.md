# Inside Airbnb: Cape Town Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listings in Cape Town to provide insights for hosts, travelers, and policymakers. Using data from Inside Airbnb, we aim to optimize pricing strategies, understand guest preferences, and assess the impact of Airbnb on the housing market.

## Business Problem
Cape Town's short-term rental market is competitive, with hosts seeking ways to maximize revenue and occupancy rates. Travelers need recommendations for the best locations and property types. Policymakers require insights into Airbnb’s influence on housing affordability and urban planning.

## Objectives
1. **Understand Market Trends**
   - Analyze the distribution of listings, pricing variations, and seasonal demand.
   - Identify factors influencing price differences across neighborhoods.

2. **Optimize Pricing Strategies for Hosts**
   - Discover factors contributing to higher occupancy rates.
   - Develop a dynamic pricing model based on demand patterns.

3. **Analyze Guest Preferences & Review Sentiment**
   - Extract key themes from guest reviews to determine satisfaction drivers.
   - Identify common complaints to improve hosting services.

4. **Assess Housing & Urban Planning Impact**
   - Examine Airbnb’s distribution across neighborhoods.
   - Investigate potential effects on housing availability and affordability.

5. **Enhance the Guest Experience**
   - Recommend ideal locations based on traveler needs (budget-friendly, luxury, family-friendly stays).
   - Suggest data-driven improvements in amenities and property features.
